----------- Overall evaluation -----------
The authors present a new result for WCET, i.e. applying model
checking for a processor with dynamic branch prediction. pipelines are
formally modelled in Uppaal and its value is validated using the
Malardalen benchmarks.

The paper is easy to read, well written. The results are significant
and relevant
