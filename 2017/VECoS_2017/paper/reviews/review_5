----------- Overall evaluation -----------
The paper considers WCET analysis of pipelined processors with dynamic
branch and target prediction. The authors show how to solve the
problem using model checking.

For this, they represent the program using a model that has 2 parts:
an array of data structures that is given to the model of the pipeline
to mimic the timing behavior, and an automaton to mimic the
functionnal behavior. The authors give then this model to the tool
UPPAAL which outputs the following information for each model: the
number of states explored, the CPU time used, and the memory used.

The experimental results show that the approach is promising. Thus, I
think the paper can be accepted.
