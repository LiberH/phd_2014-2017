\begin{abstract}
In this paper, we investigate the case for model checking in the WCET analysis of pipelined processors with dynamic branch and target prediction.
We consider a microarchitecture inspired by the e200z4 Power 32-bit architecture, with an instruction cache, a dynamic branch prediction mechanism, a branch target buffer (BTB) and  % Faut-il faire la distinction entre les deux ? Idem pour la suite de l'article.
 an instruction prefetch buffer.
 The conjoint operation of all these components produce a very complex behaviour that is difficult to analyse with tight and sound static analysis techniques.
We show that model checking techniques can actually be used to compute WCET bounds for this kind of architectures.
