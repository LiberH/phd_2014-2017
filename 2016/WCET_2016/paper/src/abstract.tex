\begin{abstract}
  We describe the implementation of \best, a tool for slicing binary code. We
  aim to integrate this tool in a WCET estimation framework based on model
  checking. In this approach, program slicing is used to abstract the program
  model in order to reduce the state space of the system. In this article, we
  also report on the results of an evaluation of the efficiency of the abstraction technique.
