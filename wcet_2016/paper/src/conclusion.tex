\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

  This article describes the working principles of a tool that computes abstract
  models of binary executables to be processed by a WCET estimation toolchain
  based on model checking. Our tool uses program slicing to compute the set of
  memory locations of the program that have an impact on the WCET of the
  program. The content of these memory locations is tracked in the abstract
  model of the program whereas the content of the other ones is abstracted away.
  A first prototype has been implemented and evaluated. The evaluation has been
  performed on the MÃ¤lardalen benchmarks using two compilers for the PowerPC
  architecture with varying optimization levels. On average, $41\%$ of the
  registers can be abstracted. This is a promising result.
